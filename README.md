## Task
Let's get down to the brass task.

From a quick look, we know what is inside our dataset, like the different attributes:

• CRIM per capita crime rate by town
• ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
• INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town
• CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
• NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
• RM average number of rooms per dwelling
• AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
• DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
• RAD index of accessibility to radial highways
• TAX full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
• PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town
• B 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
• LSTAT PERCENT lower status of the population
• MEDV Median value of owner-occupied homes is $ 1000's

Now that we loaded the data let's peek at it.

## Description
House price is a recurring subject nowadays. In this project, you will build a model to predict the price base on predefined criteria.

We are providing a dataset, the Boston housing prices.

This project is divided into two parts:
1# Understand the data
2# Build a linear regression prediction model.
